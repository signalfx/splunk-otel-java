# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our repository! Whether it's a bug
report, new feature, or question, we greatly value feedback and contributions from
our community. Read through this document before submitting any issues or pull
requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond
to your bug report or contribution.

In addition to this document, review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For any code of conduct questions or comments, send an email to oss@splunk.com.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest
features. When filing an issue, check existing open, or recently closed,
issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Try
to include as much information as you can. Details like these can be useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of our code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
- Any known workarounds

When filing an issue, do *NOT* include:

- Internal identifiers such as Jira tickets
- Any sensitive information related to your environment, users, etc.

## Reporting Security Issues

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#reporting-security-issues) for instructions.

## Documentation

The Splunk Observability documentation is hosted on the [Splunk Observability
Cloud docs site](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability), which contains all the
prescriptive guidance for Splunk Observability products. Prescriptive guidance
consists of step-by-step instructions, conceptual material, and decision support
for customers. Reference documentation and development documentation is still
hosted on this repository.

To contribute documentation for this project, open a pull request in the
[public-o11y-docs](https://github.com/splunk/public-o11y-docs) repository. See
the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/splunk/public-o11y-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
guide of the Splunk Observability Cloud documentation for more information.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via Pull Requests (PRs) are much appreciated. Before sending us a
pull request, make sure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the `main` branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure
   someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your
   time to be wasted.
4. You submit PRs that are easy to review and ideally less 500 lines of code.
   Multiple PRs can be submitted for larger contributions.

To send us a pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; a single change per PR is recommended. If you also
   reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass and add new tests related to the contribution.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request
   interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and
   stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional documentation on [forking a
repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [creating a pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute
on. As our repositories, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels
(enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at
any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.

## Licensing

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for our repository's licensing. We will ask you to
confirm the licensing of your contribution.

### Contributor License Agreement

Before contributing, you must sign the [Splunk Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/contributions.html).
