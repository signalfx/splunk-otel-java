# Metrics and attributes

> :construction: &nbsp;Status: Experimental - exported metric data and
> configuration properties may change.

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java agent gathers basic application metrics.
[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/)
and [Micrometer SignalFx registry](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/signalFx)
gather and export metrics to either [SignalFx SmartAgent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/)
or the [Splunk distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector).

Because this feature is still experimental, metrics are not enabled by default. 
To enable metrics, add `-Dsplunk.metrics.enabled=true` to the JVM
arguments or set the environment variable `SPLUNK_METRICS_ENABLED` to `true`. 
For more information, please see the [advanced configuration](advanced-config.md#splunk-distribution-configuration)
for details.

## Default metric tags

The following dimensions are automatically added to all metrics exported by the agent:

| Tag name                 | Tag value |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| `deployment.environment` | The value of the `deployment.environment` resource attribute, if present.
| `runtime`                | The value of the `process.runtime.name` resource attribute, e.g. `OpenJDK Runtime Environment`.
| `process.pid`            | The Java process identifier (PID).
| `service`                | The value of the `service.name` resource attribute.

## Manual instrumentation

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java agent detects if the instrumented application is using Micrometer and
injects a special `MeterRegistry` implementation that allows the agent to pick up custom user-defined meters, as long as
they're registered in the global `Metrics.globalRegistry` instance provided by the Micrometer library.

### Dependencies

You'll need to add a dependency on the `micrometer-core` library to be able to export custom metrics with the javaagent.

For Maven users:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.9.3</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle users:

```kotlin
implementation("io.micrometer:micrometer-core:1.9.3")
```

The agent supports all micrometer versions starting from 1.3.

### Adding custom metrics

You can use one of meter factory methods provided by the `Metrics` class, or use meter builders and refer to
the `Metrics.globalRegistry` directly:

```java
class MyClass {
  Counter myCounter = Metrics.counter("my_custom_counter");
  Timer myTimer = Timer.builder("my_custom_timer").register(Metrics.globalRegistry);

  int foo() {
    myCounter.increment();
    return myTimer.record(this::fooImpl);
  }

  private int fooImpl() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

For more details on using the Micrometer API please consult the [Micrometer docs](ohttps://micrometer.io/docs/concepts).
